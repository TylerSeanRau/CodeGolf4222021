Current Challenge: No Numbers
===============================================================================

This challenge is quite simple, just print every number, 1 -> 100.  Each should
be followed by a newline, i.e...

1
2
3
... etc ...
100

But there's a catch!  Your source code cannot include any numbers (ASCII digits
in the range '0' -> '9').  Only upper/lower alpha and special characters are
allowed in your submission.

Good luck!  :)
